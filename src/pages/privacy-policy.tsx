          <div>4 For Joint Marketing.</div>
          <p>
            From time to time, Krystal might establish joint marketing
            relationships with other persons or entities whom we believe
            trustworthy and have privacy practices that are consistent with
            ours. In such cases and where permitted by applicable law we might
            exchange, share and/or cross-reference information, including
            information about you that will enable such persons or entities to
            contact you regarding products and services that may be of interest
            to you. If you would like to opt out of our exchange of your
            information with other marketers, please let us know by writing to
            our Support Team.
          </p>
          <div>5 In Discussion Forums.</div>
          <p>
            Content you post through the Services such as reviews, commentary on
            discussion boards or blogs, and certain social networking
            preferences (e.g. pages you “Like” or “Recommend”) may be accessible
            by other users and companies and may appear on other websites or web
            searches, and therefore this information could be read, collected,
            and used by others. Krystal cannot ensure the privacy of any
            Personal Data included in such user generated content. Please note
            that Krystal does not necessarily verify, endorse, or agree with any
            content posted in discussion forums.

          </div>
          <p>
            In the event that Krystal sells certain of its assets or goes
            through a structural change, such as a merger, acquisition by
            another company, bankruptcy, insolvency, or dissolution, to the
            extent permitted by applicable law Personal Data may be transferred
            to a third party as part of such event and thereby become subject to
            the privacy practices of that third party, which may materially

          <p>

            Personal Data in this way. 8 For Legal Compliance and Special
            Circumstances. We may be required, subject to applicable law, to
            disclose your Personal Data if: (i) it is reasonably necessary to
            comply with legal process (such as a court order, subpoena, search
            warrant, etc.) or other legal requirements of any governmental
            authority, (ii) such a disclosure would potentially mitigate our
            liability in an actual or potential lawsuit, (iii) it is necessary
            to protect our legal rights or property (such as enforcing or
            applying applicable terms and conditions and other agreements,
            including the Services’ terms of service), or (iv) it is necessary
            to protect the legal rights or property or physical security of
            others, or for the prevention or detection of crime and such
            disclosure is lawful. Data Security Krystal takes precautions to

            unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification and disclosure.
            Such measures include technological, physical and organizational
            safeguards that are appropriate given the sensitivity of the
            personal information, including maintaining controlled access to
            electronic and paper documents and files, and using appropriate
            technology safeguards such as passwords firewalls and encryption as
            well as non-disclosure or confidentiality agreements as we deem
            appropriate to protect your data. However, please note that

            providing or improving Krystal’s Services and product offerings and
            this Policy, except if required otherwise by applicable law. We may
            further retain and use data as necessary to comply with our legal
            obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. Cookies
            and Other Data Collection Tools Krystal and its partners use various

            using the Services you consent to the use of such technologies,
            including cookies and pixel tags, to collect information about you.

            access or use the Services, our web server may send a cookie to your
            device. “Cookies” are small data files placed on a device’s hard
            drive or memory when you interact with a website or view a message.
            Among other things, cookies support the integrity of our
            registration process, retain your preferences and account settings,
            and help evaluate and compile aggregated statistics about user
            activity. We may use cookies to: ◦ Remember that you have visited us
            or used the Services before and personalize our content for you and
            remember your preferences (for example, your choice of language or
            region). ◦ Ensure we have enough capacity to accommodate all of our
            users and that users are finding what they are looking for easily
            and do not encounter technical errors. ◦ Collect anonymous
            statistical information about how you use the Services (including
            the length of your web or application session) and the location from
            which you access the Services, so that we can improve the Services
            and learn which elements and functions of the Services are most
            popular with our users ◦ Helps us and our ad partners to deliver ads
            or messages that are relevant to you and your interests. We may also
            share this information with third parties for this purpose. For

            about items you have left in your cart and make other purchasing
            recommendations. 2 We Use Third-Party Cookies. We may allow third
            parties to collect information via the Services through cookies,
            third party plug-ins and widgets. Third party cookies enable third
            party features or functionality to be provided on or through the
            Sites (e.g., we may use Google Analytics and Google Adwords to
            collect and process certain analytics data). 3 How We Use Web
            Beacons. Some of our websites and Services may contain electronic
            images called “web beacons”. Web beacons are objects embedded in a
            web page or email which are used to check if a user has accessed
            content. In addition to allowing us to count how many persons read
            our messages, web beacons allow us to develop statistical
            information about the activities and features that most interest our
            users in order to provide more personalized content. 4 Do Not Track
            Browser Signals. Do Not Track (“DNT”) is an optional browser setting
            that allows you to express your preferences regarding tracking
            across websites. Unless required by applicable law our Sites are not
            generally configured to respond to DNT signals. We and third parties
            operating on the services may continue to collect information in the
            manner described in this Privacy Policy from web browsers that have
            enabled DNT signals or similar mechanisms. VII. How To Manage Your
            Privacy Settings We provide you several ways to manage your privacy
            settings: 1 Update your Account Information If your Account
            Information changes, you may update or delete and deactivate certain
            aspects of your Account Information by signing into and managing
            your Krystal account or, if your account does not so permit, by
            contacting us at email@gmail.com. In addition, depending on the
            nature of your account, your account management page may allow you
            to control certain aspects of how other information you submit to
            the Services is used or shared. 2 Set your preferences to opt-out of
            communications. There are several ways for you to control how
            Krystal communicates with you: ◦ Email and Mobile Messages: You have
            the ability to unsubscribe to promotional emails or text messages
            received from us by following the instructions in those emails or
            text messages. If you use more than one Service then opting out of
            the emails relating to that Service will not necessarily stop you
            receiving emails from other Services. ◦ Push Notifications: To the
            extent applicable you can manage the type of push notifications you
            receive from Krystal (if any) by modifying the settings of your
            Krystal applications and websites. You may set your mobile device to
            not allow push notifications from us. ◦ Postal Mail: You may stop
            receiving marketing materials sent by postal mail from us by writing
            to our Support Team or following the opt-out instructions that may
            be included within those communications. 3 Manage your Location.
            Most mobile devices give users the ability to control whether
            location signals are enabled. Disabling location signals will not
            allow us to collect your Location Data (by virtue of the location of
            your mobile device) and may impact the operation of a Service. If
            you have questions about how to set the location preferences for
            your device, you can contact your mobile service carrier or your
            device manufacturer. If you unsubscribe to email marketing messages
            it may take up to 10 business days before you stop receiving emails
            and we may still send you non-promotional communications, such as
            digital receipts (if applicable) and communications about your
            account. Requests to stop or update postal mail marketing
            communications may take up 6-8 weeks to process. VIII. Children The
            Services are intended for general audiences and is not directed to
            persons less than 13 years of age and we do not knowingly collect
            Personal Data from those persons. If you become aware that personal
            information about your child has been provided to Krystal without
            your consent, please contact us. If we become aware that a child
            under 13 has provided us with Personal Data, we will take steps to
            delete the information, except where we are required by applicable
            law to keep it. Third Parties We Don’t Own or Control This Privacy
            Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not
            own or control or to people that we do not employ or manage. For
            example, if you choose to pay through a third-party mechanism
            offered on our website, the information you choose to share with
            that third-party will be treated in accordance with that
            third-party’s privacy policy. This Policy does not apply to, and we
            are not responsible for, for the content of such third party
            features or the privacy practices, including third-party cookies,
            web beacons, or other tracking technologies, of such third parties.
            We encourage you to read the privacy policies of each and every
            device, website, and service that you use. How to Contact Us Krystal

            this Policy will be effective at the time it is posted. By
            continuing to access or use the Services after those changes become

            a registered account, we may notify you of any changes to our
            Privacy Policy via email and/or we may ask you to affirmatively
            acknowledge and consent to the changes the next time you use our
